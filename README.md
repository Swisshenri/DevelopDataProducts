# Develop Data Products / Peer Assignment

This work is the Peer assignment of the Developing Data Products course of Coursera John Hopkins University.

The following are the instructions to develop a Shiny based App and a presentation in R:

Shiny Application

1.	Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2.	Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3.	Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4.	Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:
1.	Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2.	Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3.	Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4.	You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5.	The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

Please see the following links:

The Presentation of the APP is in the Rpubs link:

The Shiny App with the interaction is in:

All the source code is in the Github repository.

Thank you.
